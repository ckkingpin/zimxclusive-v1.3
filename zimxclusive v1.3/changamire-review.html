        <h2><font face="Lobster"> Changamire The Album Review</font></h2>

        <center><img src="img/cover 1.jpg" width="300" height="250"></center><br>
        <p>Firstly I would like to say I have been waiting for this album for a while and to receive two weeks before its official release date to me I can only describe it as a blessing. Changamire (The Review Copy) is a 6 track offering from Gudo Guru (DKR) which is a band made up of 6 members, Joshua Mavuto (SaNgoma), Mallory Gondo (DekenyaGavi), BegottenSun (Kudakwashe Musasiwa), Tanganyika (Munyaradzi Nota), Simbarashe Ritala (NhovaPasi reMaGavi), Owen Taruvinga (GwenyaMbira). <br><br>
Upon listening to the first track you can tell this album is not going to be anything that is being played on the airwaves targeting a certain demographic; this is evident with the ever present sound of the ‘mbira’ in the background, which is a sound that is welcome to ears at any time and I firmly believe it will go a long way. <br><br>What I am trying to say it is not your typical hiphop album this an album with a heavy message for today’s generation. 
The focus on delivering majority of the music using traditional instruments on the album but still managed to involve the element of hiphop is a breathe of fresh air.
<br><br>
<strong>#1 | Changamire x Chiwoneso</strong><br><br>
The distinct voice of Chiwoneso with the `hosho’  & `mbira’ in the background, the opening title gives you that aunthentic feeling. The first line from <i>Tanganyika</i> emphasises on the fact that we will always remember the dead, asking for advice from the ancestors in regards to the life we live today.<br><br>
<i>‘Chitikandiraiwo mazano isu vepasi’</i><br><br>
Begotten Sun delivers the second verse with his trademark flow, with a well balanced mix of Shona & English, the seasoned rapper asks the ancestors for advice. They is also a valuable message in the verse, which is perseverance.<br><br>
<i>‘Nzara pamweya haisikushaya sadza’</i><br><br>
As a opening title to the album this is a very good offering.<br><br>
<strong>#2 | Huyauone</strong><br><br>

 On this track the presence of mbira is still heavy. <i>Huyaone</i> is a track addressing the current affairs of the country to our ancestors, it is relaying a message which depicts how this current generation is living. From the sextapes to the controvesial ministries are addressed on this track. Again <i>Tanganyika & Begotten Sun</i> paint a vivd picture in high definition.<br><br>
 <i>'Kana takadhakwirira hupenyu hunombo tapirira...'</i><br><br>
 <strong>#3 | Bembera x BaShupi</strong><br><br>
 <i>Ngoma dzekwedu dzorira...</i><br><br>
 This is a celebratory track, to celebrate our forefathers who left us. BaShupi sings the chorus with what I can only describe as passion and reminds me of that old authentic Zimbabwean mbira music. On this track the theme continues of giving out a positive message in the music.<br><br>
 <i>Totovaputsira kakari vawane chekumedza...</i><br><br>

<strong>#4 | Shanje x Shingi Mangoma </strong><br><br>
The title of the track gives it away. This is a track laced with the vocals of the soulful, organic Shingi Mangoma. <i>Tanganyika</i> opens the track by feeling sorry for the haters, who spend their time gossiping. Acknowledging that the people who do not wish him well do not realise he has his whole generation on his shoulders. <br><br>
<i>Begotten Sun</i> opens the second verse by proclaming his love for his wife who is happily married to & asks her to get closer and come along on this journey. In one of the lines he addresses the 'groupies' by saying:<br><br>
<i>Usandi whatsapp'e, usandi Viber mukadzi wangu anopenga...</i><br><br>
Personally this is my favourite song on the album so make sure you listen to it.<br><br>
<strong>#5 | Chaminuka x Willis WaTafi x Shingi Mangoma</strong><br><br>
The track which is opened with spoken work from Willis WaTafi in Ndebele, <i>Tanganyika</i> opens the title by asking for forgiveness from our ancestors because we have been blinded by the ones who made us leave our tradition. The track even briefly addresses the struggle people face when leaving the country heading to the south of the country. This is yet another powerful message from DKR asking the youth to keep hold of their own situation.<br><br>

<i>'Kutoyambuka masango azere makarwe nema pere...'</i><br><br>

<strong>#6 | Vana Vako x Shingi Mangoma</strong><br><br>

The final offering on the review copy of Changamire is opened by Shingi Mangoma, asking our ancestors to look after their children of Zimbabwe & not forget us. Again <i>Tanganyika</i> delivers his verse in a poetic manner which has been captivating through out the whole listening process. <br><br>
<strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br><br>
To sum up the album, it is an album I am sure I am going to be playing for years to come. As mentioned above my favourite track on the album is Shanje, they are many reasons for that and one of them being that I can guarantee at least one person has been through at least one of the scenario's mentioned on the record. Changamire is a definate purchase <i>(download)</i>in my opinion.
